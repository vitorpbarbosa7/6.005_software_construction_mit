In Python, both `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are used to define methods that are not bound to an instance, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors:

### 1. **`@staticmethod`:**
   - A `staticmethod` is a method that does **not** depend on the class or instance.
   - It **cannot** access class attributes or instance attributes.
   - It’s just a regular function inside a class, and it doesn't need any special first parameter like `self` or `cls`.
   - **Use case:** When you have a utility function that logically belongs to the class but doesn't need access to the class or its instances.

### Example of `@staticmethod`:
```python
class ExampleClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("This is a static method.")

ExampleClass.static_method()  # No instance or class reference required
```

### 2. **`@classmethod`:**
   - A `classmethod` takes the class itself as the first argument (usually named `cls`).
   - It **can** access and modify class-level attributes.
   - It’s useful when you need to access or modify the class state rather than instance-specific data.
   - **Use case:** When you need to create factory methods, change class attributes, or create alternative constructors.

### Example of `@classmethod`:
```python
class ExampleClass:
    class_attribute = "I am a class attribute"
    
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"This is a class method, and class_attribute is: {cls.class_attribute}")

ExampleClass.class_method()  # Accesses class-level attributes
```

### Differences:
- **Access to class data:** A `classmethod` can access and modify class attributes (`cls`), while a `staticmethod` cannot.
- **First parameter:** A `classmethod` requires a `cls` parameter that refers to the class itself, whereas a `staticmethod` doesn’t take any special parameter.
- **Use case:** Use `@staticmethod` for utility functions and `@classmethod` when the class itself plays a role in the method logic.

### Could you use `@classmethod` in your example?
Yes, but it wouldn't be necessary unless you want to work with or modify class-level attributes. In your `TurtleSoup` example, there’s no class attribute or class state that needs modification, so a `classmethod` wouldn’t add any benefits. The `staticmethod` is appropriate because the methods only rely on their parameters and do not need to interact with the class or instances. 

If, however, you had class-level data like default angles or global turtle properties that you wanted to adjust dynamically, then using `@classmethod` could make sense. Here's how that might look:

```python
class TurtleSoup:
    DEFAULT_ANGLE = 180.0

    @classmethod
    def calculate_regular_polygon_angle(cls, sides):
        assert sides > 2
        angle = (sides - 2) * cls.DEFAULT_ANGLE / sides
        return angle
```

In this case, the `cls.DEFAULT_ANGLE` is accessed through the `@classmethod`.
