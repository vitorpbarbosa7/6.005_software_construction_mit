### Understanding Precedence in Grammar Through Tree Structure

#### Question:
**As the sum is made of products, and finally the products have the primitives multiplied—Is this what makes the precedence occur here?**

```plaintext
root ::= sum;
@skip whitespace {
    sum ::= product ('+' product)*;
    product ::= primitive ('*' primitive)*;
    primitive ::= variable | number | '(' sum ')' | '(' product ')';
}
number ::= [0-9]+ ('.' [0-9]+)?;
variable ::= [a-zA-Z]+;
whitespace ::= [ ]+;
```

#### Answer:
Yes, exactly! The precedence is managed through the structure of the grammar, which is reflected in the **tree structure** of the parsed expression. 

1. **Precedence via Tree Depth**: 
   - The **`product`** rule, which defines multiplication (`*`), occurs deeper in the tree. This means that multiplication is evaluated before addition. 
   - The **`sum`** rule, which defines addition (`+`), occurs at a higher level in the tree and is evaluated after all the multiplications have been handled.

2. **Why This Structure Works**:
   - By defining a **sum** as consisting of **products**, and **products** being defined as **primitives** (or terms like numbers and variables) joined with multiplication (`*`), you effectively ensure that **multiplication** is evaluated first and **addition** second, just like the precedence rules in arithmetic expressions.

This structure is intuitive because it mirrors how we think about operator precedence in mathematics. **Multiplication** and **division** (which typically have higher precedence) are deeper in the tree (inside the **product**), while **addition** and **subtraction** (which typically have lower precedence) appear higher in the tree (as part of the **sum**). 

### Example:

For the expression `3 + 4 * 2`, the tree structure is:

```plaintext
       sum
      /   \
  product   +
   /  \    /  \
  3    *  4    2
           (evaluated first)
```

- The **multiplication** (`4 * 2`) happens first because it is part of the **product** rule, which is deeper in the tree.
- The **addition** (`3 + result_of_4*2`) happens next at the higher level as part of the **sum** rule.

This shows how the tree structure effectively controls the **order of operations** (or **precedence**) in a very natural way.

### Conclusion:
- **Precedence** is controlled by the **structure of the grammar**—the deeper the rule (like `product` for multiplication), the higher the precedence. The higher-level rules (like `sum` for addition) handle the lower-precedence operations.
- This recursive, hierarchical structure is elegant because it directly mirrors how we naturally handle operator precedence in mathematics. The **product** rule handles higher-precedence operations like multiplication, while the **sum** rule handles lower-precedence operations like addition.
