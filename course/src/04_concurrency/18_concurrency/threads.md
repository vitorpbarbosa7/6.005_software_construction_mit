The image you provided explains the concept of **time slicing** in the context of **thread execution** on machines with limited processors. 

### Time Slicing and Threading:

Time slicing allows for concurrency even on machines with fewer processors than threads. Here’s the main point:

- **Time slicing** is a technique where multiple threads take turns running on the processor. Even if there are more threads than processors, the operating system **switches between threads** in small time intervals (called **time slices**). 

In the image:
- **Processor 1** runs **T1** for a while, then switches to **T2**.
- **Processor 2** runs **T2**, and then it switches to **T3**.
- **T1** resumes on **Processor 1**.

### Advantage of Threads in this Scenario:

While it may seem that **time slicing** is not significantly different from running a single process in quick succession, threads still offer several **key advantages** in concurrent programming, even when time slicing is involved:

1. **Efficient Context Switching**:
   - Threads are **lightweight** compared to processes. They share the same memory space, meaning switching between threads is faster than switching between processes, which have their own memory.
   - Even if a single processor is running multiple threads (time slicing), the context switch between threads is typically much more efficient than switching between processes.

2. **Parallelism and Task Overlap**:
   - While a **single processor** can only run one thread at a time, threads can still **overlap** tasks, even with time slicing. For example, thread T1 might be processing one part of data, T2 another, and T3 yet another. If these tasks are not dependent on each other, they can be processed in parallel (overlapping), increasing the overall throughput of the system.

3. **Better Resource Utilization**:
   - When there are **multiple threads** in a single process, they can all access the same **memory space**, which is efficient in terms of both **memory** and **time**. For instance, if one thread is waiting for input/output, another thread can be processing data, keeping the CPU busy.

4. **Simplified Code for Concurrency**:
   - Threads make it easier to write programs that perform multiple tasks concurrently. You don’t need to create complex communication mechanisms as you would with processes (using inter-process communication, for example). Threads can directly share memory, making certain tasks much easier to implement.

5. **Non-blocking Operations**:
   - In real-world scenarios, a thread might be waiting for a disk I/O operation, network request, or other tasks to complete. Time slicing allows the program to **perform other useful work** (via other threads) while one thread is blocked, thus improving performance.

### Why Not Just Use Multiple Processes?

While it’s possible to use multiple processes for concurrent work, threads are often more efficient:

- **Processes** require more overhead because each has its own memory space. Switching between processes is more expensive, and communication between processes typically requires additional mechanisms (e.g., inter-process communication or shared memory).
- **Threads**, on the other hand, share the same memory space, so switching between threads is **faster**, and sharing data is **easier**.

### Conclusion:

The **advantage of threads** lies in their **lightweight nature**. They allow for efficient **parallel execution**, **resource sharing**, and better **task management**. Even if time slicing is used (especially on systems with fewer processors), threads allow the system to make efficient use of the processor time, running multiple concurrent tasks, which would otherwise require expensive process switching.
