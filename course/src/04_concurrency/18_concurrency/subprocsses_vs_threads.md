Yes, you can summarize it like this:

- **For CPU-bound tasks**, it's better to use the `subprocess` module in Python because **subprocesses** run in separate memory spaces and can fully utilize multiple CPU cores. This avoids the limitation of the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python, which restricts true parallel execution in threads for CPU-bound tasks.
  
- **For I/O-bound tasks**, threads are often a better choice because they allow concurrent execution while waiting for I/O operations (such as network requests, file reading, etc.). The GIL doesn't block I/O operations, so threads can be effective when performing I/O-bound tasks.

### Why not always use subprocesses?

While subprocesses offer true parallelism (since each subprocess runs in its own memory space), they come with some overhead:
1. **Initialization Time**:
   - **Subprocesses take longer to initialize** compared to threads. Each subprocess creates a separate process, which includes the overhead of setting up a new memory space and running a separate instance of the interpreter.
   - Threads, on the other hand, share the same memory space, so they are lighter and faster to initialize.

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - **Subprocesses use more memory** because each subprocess has its own memory space. If you have many subprocesses running, this can consume a significant amount of system resources.
   - **Threads share memory**, so they are more memory-efficient compared to subprocesses.

3. **Communication Overhead**:
   - Communication between subprocesses typically requires Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes or files. This adds additional complexity and can be slower than the shared-memory model used by threads, where communication is simpler.
   - Threads can directly share data, making them better suited for tasks that need frequent interaction between workers.

### When will subprocesses be worse than threads in Python?

1. **Short Tasks**:
   - If the task you're performing is very short (e.g., a simple computation), starting a new subprocess might take longer than just executing it in a thread, as subprocesses have initialization overhead. In such cases, threads will be more efficient.
   
2. **High Communication Needs**:
   - If your tasks require frequent communication between workers (e.g., sharing data or intermediate results), threads are better because they share memory space. Subprocesses, however, require more complex communication mechanisms, which can become a bottleneck.

3. **Memory Constraints**:
   - If you are working with many tasks and have limited system memory, using too many subprocesses can cause memory overhead. Threads are more memory-efficient in comparison because they share memory.

4. **Simplicity**:
   - Threads are easier to manage and synchronize compared to subprocesses, especially when tasks are not CPU-bound. If the tasks are I/O-bound and the primary goal is to handle multiple tasks concurrently, threads are simpler to implement and require less setup.

### Conclusion:
- **Subprocesses** are ideal for CPU-bound tasks where true parallelism is needed, as they can fully utilize multiple cores and avoid the GIL limitation.
- **Threads** are better for I/O-bound tasks because they can efficiently handle concurrency without the overhead of creating separate processes. They are lighter and easier to manage, especially when tasks need to share memory or frequently interact.
  
In general, you should choose **subprocesses** for tasks that need intensive CPU usage and **threads** for tasks that involve waiting (such as network or file I/O).
