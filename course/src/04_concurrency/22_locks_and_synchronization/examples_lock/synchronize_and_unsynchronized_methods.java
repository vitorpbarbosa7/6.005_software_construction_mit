Let's clarify how `synchronized` works on methods in Java and what happens when you mix synchronized and non-synchronized methods:

---

### **1. Does `synchronized` on a Method Lock All Fields and Methods of the Instance?**
**No, it does not automatically lock all fields or methods of the instance.**

Here's what happens:
- **Lock on the Object (`this`)**:
  - When a thread enters a `synchronized` method, it acquires the intrinsic lock (or monitor) of the object (`this`).
  - This prevents other threads from entering **any other synchronized methods** of the same object until the lock is released.

- **Non-Synchronized Methods**:
  - Non-synchronized methods are not affected. Other threads can execute non-synchronized methods of the same object concurrently, even if a synchronized method is running.

- **Direct Access to Fields**:
  - `synchronized` does not automatically protect the fields of the object from being accessed directly. If a thread modifies fields directly or through non-synchronized methods, those modifications will not be blocked by the lock.

---

### **2. Example: Mixing Synchronized and Non-Synchronized Methods**
Let’s explore this with an example.

```java
class SharedData {
    private int balance = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited. Balance: " + balance);
    }

    // Non-synchronized method
    public void showBalance() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " checking balance: " + balance);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData account = new SharedData();

        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                account.deposit(10); // Synchronized method
            }
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                account.showBalance(); // Non-synchronized method
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task1, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task2, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
    }
}
```

---

### **What Happens Here?**
1. **Synchronized `deposit()`**:
   - When `t1` executes `deposit()`, it acquires the lock on the `account` object.
   - No other thread can enter any synchronized method on the same object while the lock is held.

2. **Non-Synchronized `showBalance()`**:
   - `t2` can execute `showBalance()` concurrently with `deposit()`, even though `deposit()` is synchronized.
   - This can result in `showBalance()` reading an **inconsistent state** of `balance` because it’s not protected by the lock.

3. **Output**:
   - The order of `deposit()` and `showBalance()` calls is unpredictable:
     ```
     Thread-2 checking balance: 0
     Thread-1 deposited. Balance: 10
     Thread-1 deposited. Balance: 20
     Thread-2 checking balance: 20
     Thread-1 deposited. Balance: 30
     Thread-2 checking balance: 30
     ```

### **3. What Happens When Methods Are Mixed?**
#### **Scenario 1: All Methods Are Synchronized**
- If all methods are synchronized, only one thread can execute any method on the object at a time.
- This ensures full protection of shared data but may reduce concurrency.

#### **Scenario 2: Some Methods Are Synchronized, Some Are Not**
- Non-synchronized methods can execute concurrently with synchronized methods.
- This can lead to **race conditions** if non-synchronized methods read or modify shared fields directly.

#### **Scenario 3: Fields Are Accessed Directly**
- If fields are accessed directly without using synchronized methods, those accesses are not protected by the lock.
- This bypasses synchronization entirely and can cause unpredictable behavior.

---

### **4. Best Practices**
1. **Synchronize Access to Shared Fields**:
   - If multiple threads access a shared field, ensure all accesses are protected by the same lock.
   - Either use synchronized methods or explicitly synchronize on a shared lock.

2. **Consistency in Synchronization**:
   - Avoid mixing synchronized and non-synchronized methods that access the same shared data unless you’re certain it’s safe.

3. **Immutable Data**:
   - Use immutable objects for shared data if possible, to avoid synchronization issues.

4. **Consider Fine-Grained Locking**:
   - Instead of synchronizing the entire object (`this`), use specific locks for different parts of the code if needed.

---

### **5. Example: Fixing Inconsistencies**
To fix the inconsistencies in the previous example, make all methods that access `balance` synchronized:

```java
class SharedData {
    private int balance = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited. Balance: " + balance);
    }

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void showBalance() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " checking balance: " + balance);
    }
}
```

Now `showBalance()` will also acquire the lock on `account`, ensuring that `balance` is always read in a consistent state.

---

### **Summary**
- **`synchronized` on a method locks the object (`this`)** but does not automatically lock all fields or methods.
- Non-synchronized methods and direct field access bypass the lock, which can lead to race conditions.
- To ensure thread safety:
  - Synchronize all methods that access shared data.
  - Avoid direct field access outside synchronized methods.
- Mixing synchronized and non-synchronized methods can work, but it requires careful design to avoid inconsistencies.
