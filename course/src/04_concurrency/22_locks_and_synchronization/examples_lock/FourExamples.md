The explanation emphasizes that **locks in Java provide mutual exclusion** only for **threads using the same lock object**. It clarifies a common misconception: simply acquiring a lock on an object does not prevent other threads from accessing that object directly — it only prevents other threads from entering **synchronized blocks** or methods using the same lock.

Let's break this down with examples.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Locks Guard Shared Data**:
   - A lock is used to protect shared variables or data.
   - Threads must agree on which lock to use to ensure mutual exclusion.

2. **Locks Don’t Automatically Block Access**:
   - Acquiring a lock on an object (`synchronized(obj)`) does not prevent other threads from accessing the object directly (e.g., reading or writing its fields).
   - It only prevents them from entering other `synchronized(obj)` blocks until the lock is released.

3. **Consistency in Lock Usage**:
   - All threads accessing the shared data must use the **same lock** to ensure thread safety.
   - Using different locks to guard the same data defeats the purpose.

---

### **Examples**

#### **1. Correct Lock Usage**
Here, multiple threads use the **same lock** to protect access to a shared variable.

```java
class SharedData {
    private int balance = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Shared lock

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        synchronized (lock) { // Acquires the lock
            balance += amount;
        } // Releases the lock
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        synchronized (lock) { // Acquires the same lock
            return balance;
        } // Releases the lock
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData account = new SharedData();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                account.deposit(1);
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Balance: " + account.getBalance()); // Always prints 2000
    }
}
```

- **What Happens Here**:
  - Both threads (`t1` and `t2`) use the **same lock (`lock`)** to protect access to `balance`.
  - Mutual exclusion ensures that only one thread at a time can modify or read the `balance` variable.

---

#### **2. Incorrect Lock Usage**
If threads use **different locks** to protect the same variable, mutual exclusion fails.

```java
class SharedData {
    private int balance = 0;
    private final Object lock1 = new Object(); // Lock 1
    private final Object lock2 = new Object(); // Lock 2

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        synchronized (lock1) { // Acquires Lock 1
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        synchronized (lock2) { // Acquires Lock 2
            return balance;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData account = new SharedData();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                account.deposit(1);
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Balance: " + account.getBalance()); // May print incorrect result
    }
}
```

- **What Happens Here**:
  - `deposit()` uses `lock1` while `getBalance()` uses `lock2`.
  - Since the locks are **different**, there is no mutual exclusion between the threads.
  - This leads to **race conditions**, and the `balance` might not be updated correctly.

---

#### **3. Locks Don’t Prevent Direct Access**
Locks **do not prevent direct access to an object’s fields**. Other threads can bypass the lock entirely if they don’t use synchronized blocks.

```java
class SharedData {
    public int balance = 0; // Public field

    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) { // Locks on "this"
        balance += amount;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData account = new SharedData();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                account.deposit(1); // Uses synchronized method
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                account.balance -= 1; // Directly modifies balance (ignores lock)
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Balance: " + account.balance); // Result is unpredictable
    }
}
```

- **What Happens Here**:
  - Thread `t1` uses the synchronized `deposit()` method to modify `balance`.
  - Thread `t2` bypasses the lock entirely by directly accessing `balance`.
  - The result is **unpredictable** because the lock only protects code within the `synchronized` block, not the field itself.

---

#### **4. Using the Same Lock for Multiple Variables**
To ensure consistency, all shared variables can be guarded by the **same lock**.

```java
class SharedData {
    private int balance1 = 0;
    private int balance2 = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Single shared lock

    public void transfer(int amount) {
        synchronized (lock) { // Protects both variables
            balance1 -= amount;
            balance2 += amount;
        }
    }

    public int[] getBalances() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            return new int[]{balance1, balance2};
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData account = new SharedData();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                account.transfer(1);
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        int[] balances = account.getBalances();
        System.out.println("Balances: " + balances[0] + ", " + balances[1]); // Always consistent
    }
}
```

- **What Happens Here**:
  - Both `balance1` and `balance2` are protected by the same lock (`lock`).
  - All threads use the same lock to ensure consistent updates to both variables.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Locks in Java **only provide mutual exclusion for threads using the same lock**. Direct access to fields or using different locks can break thread safety.
2. To ensure thread safety:
   - Guard all accesses to shared data with the **same lock**.
   - Avoid direct field access if it bypasses synchronization.
3. **Consistency in locking** is crucial to avoid race conditions and maintain predictable behavior in multi-threaded programs.
