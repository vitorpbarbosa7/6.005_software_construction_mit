**I/O-bound tasks** are operations where the limiting factor in performance is not the CPU but rather the **input/output (I/O) operations** that the system is performing. These tasks typically involve waiting for external resources or devices, and during this wait time, the CPU is not actively processing information. Because the system is waiting for I/O operations to complete, these tasks can benefit from parallelism (e.g., using multiple threads) to improve efficiency.

### Common Examples of I/O-bound Tasks:

1. **Network Requests**:
   - Sending or receiving data over a network (e.g., HTTP requests to a web server, database queries, file transfers, etc.). During this operation, the CPU is not doing heavy computation but rather waiting for the data to come back from the network.

2. **Disk I/O**:
   - Reading from or writing to files on disk. Disk access speed is usually much slower than the CPU, so the system spends a lot of time waiting for the disk to respond, making disk I/O operations I/O-bound.
   - Examples include opening large files, saving files, reading logs, or loading data from a file.

3. **Database Queries**:
   - Interacting with a database (e.g., querying, updating, or inserting records). The system often waits for the database to process the request and return the result, rather than performing CPU-intensive operations.

4. **User Input**:
   - Waiting for input from the user (e.g., keyboard input, mouse clicks, etc.). The program might be idle while waiting for the user to provide data or make a decision.

5. **Web Scraping**:
   - Scraping websites by sending HTTP requests and waiting for responses. During this process, the CPU is typically not used intensively while the program waits for the content of the web page.

6. **File System Operations**:
   - Operations that involve reading or writing data to disk, like loading files, copying files, or even database operations involving disk storage.

7. **Cloud Service API Calls**:
   - Interacting with remote cloud services via APIs. These calls involve waiting for data to be retrieved or stored in the cloud, which can take time due to network latency.

8. **Streaming Data**:
   - When you are receiving data in chunks, such as from a sensor, a media server (e.g., streaming a video), or a live feed, the process is typically I/O-bound because the program is waiting for data to arrive before processing it.

### Why Are These Tasks I/O-bound?

These tasks are considered **I/O-bound** because their performance is limited by the speed of the I/O device or resource they depend on, such as:
- The **network speed** for web requests or cloud APIs.
- The **disk read/write speed** for file operations.
- The **latency and throughput** of remote databases.

Since the CPU is idle during the waiting time for these operations to complete, they are not utilizing the CPU's full capacity, making it an I/O-bound task.

### Why Use Threads for I/O-bound Tasks?

Threads are useful for I/O-bound tasks because:
- When one thread is waiting for an I/O operation (e.g., waiting for a response from a network request), other threads can continue executing, thus improving overall throughput and responsiveness.
- Threads can help in **parallelizing** tasks that are not CPU-intensive but need to handle multiple I/O operations concurrently (e.g., handling multiple user requests or processing multiple files at the same time).

In contrast, for **CPU-bound tasks**, where the task is limited by the processing power of the CPU (e.g., complex calculations, machine learning algorithms), using threads doesn't provide the same benefit due to the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python, which restricts true parallelism.
