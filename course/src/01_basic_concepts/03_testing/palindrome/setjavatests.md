### What Are JUnit and Hamcrest?

1. **JUnit**:
   - JUnit is a **testing framework** for Java. It allows you to write test cases to check that your code works as expected. 
   - JUnit provides a set of annotations, assertions, and utilities to run unit tests, handle setup/teardown, and organize tests.
   - For example, using `@Test` annotation, you can define methods that are run as test cases, and with `assertEquals` or other assert methods, you can compare expected and actual results.
   
2. **Hamcrest**:
   - Hamcrest is a **library of matchers** that can be used with JUnit to write more expressive and readable test assertions.
   - It allows you to write tests that are more flexible and descriptive, such as `assertThat(value, is(equalTo(expectedValue)))`.
   - While JUnit comes with basic assert methods, Hamcrest provides more complex matchers like `greaterThan`, `containsString`, or `hasItems`.

### Setting Up Better Commands or Aliases

Since your `.jar` files are in a fixed location, you can set up environment variables, or aliases to make compiling and running your tests easier. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Setting Environment Variables in Your Shell Configuration**
   
   Add these lines to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile` file:
   ```bash
   export JUNIT_PATH=/Users/yourusername/junit-4.13.2.jar
   export HAMCREST_PATH=/Users/yourusername/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
   export CLASSPATH=.:$JUNIT_PATH:$HAMCREST_PATH
   ```

   Then, reload the configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
   ```

2. **Creating Aliases**

   Add these lines to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile` to make it easier to compile and run tests:
   ```bash
   alias javac-test='javac -cp $CLASSPATH'
   alias java-test='java -cp $CLASSPATH'
   ```

   Then, to use these aliases:
   ```bash
   javac-test PalindromeTest.java  # Compile
   java-test org.junit.runner.JUnitCore PalindromeTest  # Run tests
   ```

### Explanation:
- **`export`** sets environment variables (`JUNIT_PATH`, `HAMCREST_PATH`, and `CLASSPATH`) so you can easily use them in commands.
- **`alias`** creates shortcuts. `javac-test` compiles with the required `.jar` files in the classpath, and `java-test` runs your tests with the required classpath set up.
  
By setting this up, you won't need to manually specify the `.jar` paths every time. This approach makes compiling and running tests more efficient and consistent across your projects.
