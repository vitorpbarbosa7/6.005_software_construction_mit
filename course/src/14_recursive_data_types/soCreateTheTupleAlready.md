Let's break this down to understand why the mentioned points are correct.

---

### 1. **Static checking of the number of objects in the pair**
Static checking happens **at compile time**. When using a Java `Object[]` or `List<Object>` to represent pairs, the compiler cannot enforce that there are exactly two elements in the structure. 

For example:
```java
Object[] pair = new Object[3]; // This compiles but is invalid for a pair
pair[0] = "Variable";
pair[1] = true;
pair[2] = false; // This violates the intended structure of a pair
```

The compiler **does not know** that `Object[]` is supposed to represent a pair with exactly two elements. This lack of enforcement makes it error-prone. **Static checking of the number of elements is not provided.**

---

### 2. **Static checking that we only access valid indices in the pair**
Again, with `Object[]`, the compiler cannot enforce that you only access indices `0` and `1`. It will allow you to try accessing any index:
```java
Object[] pair = new Object[]{"Variable", true};
System.out.println(pair[2]); // Compiles fine but throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime
```

The compiler has no way to know that `pair` is only intended to have two elements and that accessing `pair[2]` is invalid. **Static checking of valid indices is not provided.**

---

### Why Only Dynamic Checking Works for These Cases
- **Dynamic checking** happens **at runtime**. For example, `Object[]` and `List<Object>` provide runtime bounds checking:
  - If you try to access an invalid index, you'll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
  - This ensures that the program does not proceed with invalid memory access.
- However, dynamic checking cannot enforce the size or structure of the data â€” it can only catch errors during execution.

---

### Comparison to a Better Design
Using a custom `Pair` class or a dedicated tuple-like structure solves these problems:

```java
class Pair<V, B> {
    private final V variable;
    private final B value;

    public Pair(V variable, B value) {
        this.variable = variable;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public V getVariable() {
        return variable;
    }

    public B getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

Here:
- **Static checking of the number of objects in the pair**: You can only construct a `Pair` with exactly two values (`variable` and `value`).
- **Static checking of valid indices**: Accessing the pair elements is done through `getVariable()` and `getValue()`, making invalid indices impossible.

This makes the design safer and avoids runtime errors caused by accessing invalid indices or misusing the structure.

---

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:
- **Static checking of the number of objects in the pair**: Not provided with `Object[]`.
- **Static checking that we only access valid indices in the pair**: Not provided with `Object[]`.

Dynamic bounds checking exists, but that's only a partial safety measure. Using a custom class like `Pair` is a better approach in Java to ensure both static and runtime correctness.
